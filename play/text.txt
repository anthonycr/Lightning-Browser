U2F Browser is a simple, fast web browser that focuses on design, security, and efficiency. 
It is based on the Lightning Browser but adds U2F to the feature set.

The FIDO U2F standard allows for two-factor authentication with web services. It protects your account by using a hardware Security Key in addition to your username and password. It has been deployed successfully by large services, including Google, Facebook, Dropbox and Salesforce.

Our SDK provides a FIDO client for Android that works with Security Keys (FIDO authenticators), such as YubiKeys, over NFC and USB.
