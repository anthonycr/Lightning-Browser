This means that you MUST provide attribution in your application to Lightning Browser for the use of this code. The way you can do this is to provide a separate screen in settings showing what open-source libraries and/or apps (this one) you used in your application. You must also open-source any files that you use from this repository and if you use any code at all from this repository, the file you put it in must be open-sourced according the the MPL 2.0 license. To put it simply, if you create a fork of this browser, your browser must be open-source, no exceptions. The only way to avoid open-sourcing a file is to completely write all the code yourself and to not use any code from Lightning. This is in order to provide a way for companies to utilize the code without making private server code public. For further explanation, please email me, or seek legal counsel :-P
